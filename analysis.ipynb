      "Review: **Update 6/2010: THIS IS A SUMMERTIME RECORDThis record was originally released in the wintertime, but it is not a wintertime record. I knew something was a little \"off\" but I could not quite figure it out. Classic MJB is bold and rich, like a cappuccino. This particular record is \"open\" and \"breezy\" which did not match the feeling of winter. Now that the weather is warmer I am feeling this much more and getting into it. The song \"I Love You (Yes I Do)\" is reminiscent of (classic) \"I'm The Only Woman\" while the overall feel of the record is very breezy.This album is pretty decent. I think it may be a little too mainstream. I guess that is what they are going for these days. Mary does sing well on this set. The problem with this record and the previous one is that the production is mismatched. I think it is kind of formulaic. Oh well- that's the market side of things. In my own opinion, I am ready for Mary to get with a college band and cut-it-up James and 'Retha-style. Better production chemistry would bring out a better side of her. You can tell when someone like Mary J. is really feeling the music. I'm ready for her to return to some bass-heavy stuff, or maybe collaborate with The Roots, or do an album of standards (with an actual band). Make music for the true fans who are devoted.\n",

      "Review: D'ya know when bands let you down? Like, when their third or fourth album delivers a &quot;radical, minimalist departure&quot; from their old material, which is basically what you wanted? In Book M, the Secret Chiefs have done the opposite of that. They have given you their dole of Islamic Sufiism, surf rock and techno, but MORESO; Book M is solidly produced and more badass than ever. And so many colors in the palette: &quot;Blaze of the Grail&quot; pays hommage to the film scores of Bollywood and Iran; &quot;Safina&quot; brings in a hypnotic saxophone melody separate but not disparate from the autochthonous instruments; &quot;Zulfiqar III&quot; (A SC3 favorite) is a droll march into electronica; &quot;Horsemen of the Invisible&quot; gives you an intense Gypsy fire dance. All the song figures are traditional, which would smack of unoriginality if the songs were not so drastically re-worked or if any of us knew anything about Middle Eastern music. The underlying theme in &quot;Hagia Sophia&quot; (&quot;Holy Wisdom&quot;) is masterfully, mind-numbingly recapitulated where you would least expect it. Buy, buy, buy! In any other world, this album would be priceless!\n",

      "Review: The word \"brutal\" is often applied to death metal.  In fact, in virtually every DM review you read, \"brutal\" is an adjective that gets thrown around quite a bit.  Suffocation, unlike some of their peers, is a band that truly deserves the rank of \"brutal.\"  \"Effigy of the Forgotten\" is one sick release.  The level of musicianship is mindblowing.  Guitar riffs pound your ears from every direction, reeking of savage technicality.  HARSH vocals growl and grunt like some kind of demon.  The drumming is beyond phenomenal, with some unique twists on the average blastbeat.  I love the production here; the guitars and bass pack one massive low-end wallop.  While some may complain that it is not clear enough, I think the murkiness gives an added dimension to the proceedings.  Lyrics are far more intelligent and thoughtful than the average death metal band.  While they are still very violent and dark, they show a much more literate approach than Cannibal Corpse or Mortician.  All these elements come together quite nicely for what can be described as a \"classic\" in death metal, something that is rare in genre filled with cookie-cutter clones who offer nothing new.  If you are a fan of the harder forms of death metal, you would do well to purchase this.  And if you enjoy Suffocation, check out Immolation, Cryptopsy, and Origin for more technical DM mayhem\n",

      "Review: Seventh Tree, Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory's fourth album, was a bit of a detour from the glossy, `80s pop sheen of their last couple of records, drawing more from Brian Eno-inspired soundscapes, nature, and pagan worship than your typical electro-diva effort. Predictably, it also sold less than Goldfrapp's previous work, so it should come as little surprise that their fifth album returns unabashedly to the roots of Goldfrapp's [financial] success. I could say that Head First combines the up-tempo, synth-heavy electronic dance of Supernature and Black Cherry with some of the ambient, folkier sounds of their superb debut and Seventh Tree, but that sort of mixture is more often the exception rather than the rule. No, Head First rather brazenly throws everything to the wind and kneels to its glam-pop influences without an ounce of shame.Nevertheless, this is catchy as hell. Gregory has always shined brightest when the beats bumping behind Goldfrapp's airy vocals are pulsating, oscillating glimmers of sound, usually making liberal use of bass and space-age synthesizers. One listen to \"Believer\" will have that chorus stuck in your head for days, and while jams like \"Alive\" and \"I Wanna Life\" are so disco, so shiny and slick that it almost feels wrong to listen to them without dusting off a polyester pantsuit and platform shoes, there's something refreshing and exhilarating about such straightforward retro pop. There are plenty of synthesizers and effects, but it enhances rather than obscures Goldfrapp's inviting voice, and many of the hooks here, particularly the dark, glitchy rhythm of \"Shiny and Warm,\" blow away most current Top 40 material.That's hardly an excuse, however, for just how dated some of the sounds come off. Lead single \"Rocket\" is the perfect example: just the kind of smart, toe-tapping songwriting one has come to expect from Goldfrapp and Gregory, but trapped under the weight of synths that sound as if they came straight off the rack at your local Sam Ash, circa 1984. Perhaps that was the sound Goldfrapp was going for, but on too many songs here the effect comes off as cheap, dated, and more than a little off-putting. It also causes much of Head First to bleed together, resulting in something like the ninth circle of hell for those who hate John Hughes movies.Luckily, the duo mixes it up enough as the record winds down to prevent any sugar overdose. There's a Seventh Tree throwback on the haunting, vaguely threatening \"Hunt,\" and the aforementioned \"Shiny and Warm\" tops most of the earlier, more immediately accessible dance tunes. Closer \"Voicething,\" meanwhile, is such a 180-degree shift in sound and mood that it's as if Goldfrapp had just thrown her hands up in the studio and said, \"Well, **** it, I like everything we did on Felt Mountain better.\" It's surprising how relaxing and revitalizing the continued layering of Goldfrapp's many soft whispers and murmurs can sound on top of the record's most restrained beats, and it's a near revelation in just how versatile Goldfrapp can be after the nonstop party that precedes it. Head First is nothing if not a party album, especially if said party has a retro theme, and on that count Goldfrapp have outdone themselves once again. But where Seventh Tree was inconsistent, Head First suffers from a lack of much of any substance, and even the occasional toss into left field is notable only for its extrinsic nature. Then again, who ever said great disco needed substance?\n",

      "Review: This score isn't so bad, yet it isn't so good either. The themes are overly repetitive and aren't complex. The main theme is yet efficient, representing a dark hero, just like batman. The Transylvania theme is powerful, rapid, and expresses more than well the action in the movie. The guitar has been very well used in that theme.In overall, it remains an average quality soundtrack, much like Hellboy and other big dumb action movie scores. It does remind Danny Elfman's style, and much of the themes reminds of the original Batman score put on steroids. I better like Batman, it was more well conceived, and the pain is more noticeable, while Van Helsing's seems a bit fake.\n",

      "Review: Breakbeat Era consists of Leonie Laws, DJ Die, and Roni Size. The CD mixes surprisingly detailed drum n bass beats with female vocals. The tracks are as good as Goldies, the fact that they have a female singer complimenting the beats makes it more open to a wider range of audiences. Instead of pure drum n' bass CDs, it doesn't get tedious once it hits the halfway mark. All three of the musicians compliment each other immaculately. DJ Die is typically an okay musician on his own, so is Roni, but when all three colab, all of their individual styles are audible in the conglomerate of cadance, and they all mesh so well.The only, and I mean *only*, problem I have with the CD is something that cant really be helped - Leonie's voice. She has a really attractive and ear-catching voice, really. But after hearing the voice for tracks on end, it can become a little annoying. It has the spark of billy corrigan's but gets somewhat distracting close to the later portion of the LP. This really deserves 4.5/5 just because it's such a minor infraction, but since it's something so negligible, the decimal should just be rounded up. It's one of the better d n b CDs and groups I've heard in a while.\n",

The sound is a mix of rock, protopunk and punk rock with very provocative lyrics. The booklet contains a letter written by Clive Davis and liner-notes by Patti Smith herself. The booklet also contains several photographs of Patti Smith and her band. I had heard the song \"Because of the night\" before listening to this compilation but I had no idea that Patti Smith had written as a collaboration with Bruce Springsteen.

From the slight jazz of \"Snowed In\" to the noise-and-noir of \"A Sneaking Suspicion,\" he proves his musical chops and his understanding of craftsmanship. \"Aim True\" starts with classical strings, but quickly shifts into a swirling collage of sound and rhythms, structured around a mysterious vocal sample. Indeed, all the tracks have something to offer, like the dreamy drum 'n' bass of \"Scaling Snowdon\" or the house beats and easy listening filters of \"Something Bells\" or the tinkling fairy bells and frantic rhythms of \"Overdressed.\" No fear of flying too close to the sun here; Daedelus flies away a rousing success.\n",

      "Review: Incubus' albums...what can I say? I enjoy them all. Old and new. ''A Crow Left Of The Murder'' wasn't bad but I prefer other Incubus albums. First off, yes their sound is a bit different but that's not it. It's good the album. I just don't like some songs though. Overall, Incubus DID say that this album took only 4 weeks to make. But that's not why it's not my first Incubus album choice. It's just that certain songs weren't....''there'' as some people say. I did enjoy some though. Some including; ''Sick Sad Little World'', ''Agoraphobia'', ''Here In My Room'', ''Smile Lines'' and more. Although some tracks...let's just say that I wasn't ''feeling'' them. Those are: ''Priceless'', and ''Zee Deveel.'' Other than that though, this album was good but not Incubus' greatest. I'm sure though that their next album will be good. (Just like the others.)

Where they were formerly very thrashy/harsh, here they are harmonic and more melodic.  This was the one  that sent them into the indie-punk big-time, and rightfully so.  Soaring,  hard yet melodic tunes that maintain a unique quality amongst a field of  generic bands.  Their post-Leche efforts have been alright, but this one  stands out as their finest moment.

      "Review: Two years after her lackluster debut, Jennifer Lopez, now known as the street-smart J Lo, released her sophomore album, the aptly titled \"J Lo\". 2001, the year that this was released, seemed to be the year when every artist was trying to get street-cred and enlisted the help of many rappers to do so. Of course, J Lo was no exception. Once again, J Lo had a hand in writing a few of the tracks and enlisted the help of some of the same writers as before (notably, P Diddy and Mario Winans). The main difference between this album and her debut is that \"J Lo\" has more upbeat tracks whereas \"On The 6\" had more ballads. Otherwise, they're virtually interchangeable.\"J Lo\" starts off with possibly her biggest hit, \"Love Don't Cost A Thing\" which actually has a decent message. In this song, J Lo tries to tell her man that \"all that matters is that you treat me right, give me all the things I need that money can't buy\". In other words, he's trying to buy her love, which he already has, and what she needs is to spend time with him. The major downside to this song is the mediocre lyrics and almost excessive amounts of slang. However, unlike on her debut, the bridge of the song is lyrically the high point even though vocally it is not much different. Subsequently, come two of J Lo's other singles, \"I'm Real\" and \"Play\". \"I'm Real\" has an extremely clich&eacute;d theme and decent lyrics. It is actually one of the better songs of this theme though it does have some unaccredited rapper (I think it's P Diddy but I'm not sure) muttering phrases in the background. \"Play\" was co-written by pop singer Christina Milian. This song has little to offer in the way either vocals or lyrics but it is a decent enough dance song.Next comes one of the most irritating tracks, \"Walking On Sunshine\". The lyrics were written by no less then eight people including J Lo, herself. Unfortunately, despite the number of writers, the song still just doesn't work. Both the lyrics and the vocals are extremely grating. Next comes my personal favourite J Lo song, not just on the album but also of her entire career, \"Ain't It Funny\". Unlike most of J Lo's other Latin-influence songs, \"Ain't It Funny\" pulls off the style beautifully with great lyrics and even her vocals are better than usual.  After that come three subpar tracks, \"Carino\", \"Come Over\" and \"We Gotta Talk\". \"Carino\" is an English track with a couple of scattered Spanish words and has a generally awkward sound to it. \"Come Over\" is J Lo's attempt and a seductive ballad. Though her voice doesn't sound half bad, there's something about this song that just doesn't work. The lyrics are nice, the vocals are decent but something on this track seems out of place. \"We Gotta Talk\" is the typical upbeat song. The lyrics could have told a sweet story however the way they are sung kind of ruins it.Following this comes another personal favourite song, \"That's Not Me\". Like in most J Lo songs the background singers' presence is far to obvious but for once it adds to the effect of the song instead of taking away from it. The lyrics are truly touching and tell a wonderful story about how J Lo's man expects her to baby him like his mother did. The vocals work very well although they could have been a little more emotive.  Afterwards come another two weak tracks called \"Dance With Me,\" and \"Secretly\". \"Dance With Me\" is often difficult to distinguish from the aforementioned \"We Gotta Talk\" and since there is nothing special to distract the listener, the background singers' presence is once again too obvious. \"Secretly\" is somewhat similar to \"Come Over\". It's a slow ballad that just doesn't seem to fit in. As well, it seems that the background singers are doing the majority of the singing and J Lo only adds a few words here and there.The final five tracks are a mix of good and not so good, with, unfortunately, more missteps then not. \"I'm Gonna Be Alright\" starts the group off and it is probably the best of the final five. It at first appears to be just a typical dance track but it has the positive message to at least add some substance. It gives the message of being okay after someone you love leaves you. The second of the five is \"That's The Way\" which is, once again, similar to \"Dance With Me\" and \"We Gotta Talk\" so it really doesn't stand out. After that are two Spanish tracks called \"Dame (Touch Me)\" which is a duet with someone named Chayanne and \"Si Ya Se Acabo\". I do not speak Spanish so I can't comment too much on these two tracks. To me, they don't stand out too much but they would probably be better if I understood them. The final track is a remix to \"I'm Real\" with Ja Rule. This song is probably the sole reason for the \"explicit lyric\" warning on the front. It's a decent enough remix but it is not exactly necessary.Overall Mark: 3/5Overall, this album is only slightly better than J Lo's debut. Although the album does contain my two favourite J Lo songs ever (\"Ain't It Funny\" and \"That's Not Me\") it, like both other J Lo albums seem to value style over substance.  There is nothing wrong with an artist changing styles over time but J Lo only has three albums and each one is a completely different style. It seems that J Lo realizes her vocals are limited and her lyrics are generally subpar or average so she sticks to style and catchy beats to sell records rather than quality music. Most of all though, J Lo needs to rely less on background singers.\n",

There's not much to say except that after only a couple of listens 'Instant Street' became one of my favourite songs ever.

      "Review: If you leave a copy of Elvis' `My Aim Is True' at your parent's house, it will probably will never get played. Just look at the cover: there's a photograph of a guy who looks like Buddy Holly's secret brother who is on  temporary leave from the \"nervous hospital.\" Now try the same thing with  Kojak `Variety.' The cover is conservative and rather cool - I'll venture  that your parents will no only play it, but that they'll also enjoy it. The  words \"Rhythm &amp; Blues - Popular Ballads\" are printed in the upper  righthand corner of the CD cover. Initially, it sounds like a 180-degree  stylistic departure from the angry young punk newwaver. Not so amigo. Elvis  has been covering rhythm &amp; blues and ballads ever since he bought his  first pair of Buddy Holly glasses. `Little triggers' is a sweet little soul  number; in fact, isn't Get Happy a soul album? As for ballads, some of  Elvis' most intimate compositions are ballads (`Allison' for one  example).On Kojak Variety, `Remove This Doubt' is a heartfelt doo-wop  ballad, and `I Threw It All Away' is filled with loneliness and regret. So  what's wrong with the remaining 13 cuts? Why do they fall short of Elvis's  usually high standards? Well, I can only guess that it's because of Elvis'  lack of enthusiasm. And the band (all superb instrumentalists) sounds as  though they just what to get the recording session over with, collect their  checks, then go home. I just can't hear any conviction or passion.\n",

This focuses on the religious right's condemnation of AIDS victims.  My favorite track is &quot;The Law Of The Plague&quot;, in which she spits out Leviticus with an indescribable acidity.  I can't recommend this enough.\n",

Not one song that didn't sentshivers down my spine, not one line in the lyrics that didn't make myskin crawl, not one mistake in artwork, production andmusicanship. This is one of those albums that gets people into a styleof music. From mournful opening of &quot;Humana Inspired toNightmare&quot; to the merciless mayhem final last seconds of&quot;Haunted Shores&quot; you just got to be on your knees. Cradle ofFilth are often labeled as Black Metal which isn't all true, you can'tdescribe them in one word. Their abilities are amazing, I can't thinkof any other Black/Death/Metal Band that compares ( O.K. maybeSatyricon but that is a whole different thing ).  At the same time,the more &quot;old school&quot; black metal fans think that they areto blame for the sellout of their music. I don't think so.  They aretrue to their game they developed from &quot;Principal of Evil madeFlesh&quot; to &quot;Cruelty and the Beast&quot;. Perhaps Cradle ofFilth are that kind of thing to Black Metal which Iron Maiden is to&quot;traditional&quot; Metal (hrmmm... Music style-naming sucksanyway). I know every Cradle of Filth album, but I still think thatthis is their best. Don't think that the others aren't just as great,but this is their &quot;cenith to come&quot; ( &quot;Funeral inCarpathia&quot;). You just can't do any better than this. If you aregoing to buy one CD in the Century, that would be one of myrecommodations.  Even the one of the ancestors of black metal, Cronosmakes an appearance on &quot;haunted Shores&quot;.  END\n",

And they most likely never will. STYE has some old IF-ish elements to it (Including TJR-esque low growls in F(r)iend) and is much darker and better than RTR. Anders has really improved on his clean vocals and uses them a lot less (thank God). His death vocals are better than they were in RTR.

I do like it, but as far as my likes in music go, I don't like it as much as that album.To be perfectly honest, if I had bought this album first, I probably wouldn't have bought the others.

Unfortunately, that is the going price of this Greatest Hits, a collection containing even fewer tracks than 2003's Singles 93-03.  Billed as \"DJ only, ten ultra-rare Electronic Battle Weapon tracks\", the bonus disc seems promising until you put it in and find that the majority are demo mixes of previously released material such as \"It Doesn't Matter\", \"Under the Influence\", \"It Began in Afrika\" etc. - and these all sound fundamentally the same as the original versions!  In defense of this disc, the new tracks are really good, particularly \"Keep My Composure\", a collaboration of the Chem's sexy, soul tearing bass, arpeggiated arcade synths and MC Spank \"Can Do No Wrong\" Rock. However, unless your hard dive and physical copies recently melted, this collection is for people who think that fancy CD packaging will get them laid.\n",

      "Review: Notice the title, I used not one but TWO songs from the album to kreate it (stupid pun); I am cool.For starters boys and girls let me get something out of my system - Virushan is a complete idiot and probably didn't even listen to the album in question. At least, I hope he did not, because if he did he is even more of an idiot than I am giving him credit for being. Now that I have that off of my chest let me actually get this so called review rolling. For those of you who are not in the know or are new to this wonderful genre called 'metal', Kreator are sort of a big deal in thrash metal circles. These German titans of thrash have released several quality albums through out the years, many I personally own. \"Enemy of God\" is their latest effort, and honestly, I was half way thinking Kreator would fall flat on their face with this album and follow the trend started by a lot of other good metal bands and decided it would be cool to suck it up. But, me-o-my, how I was surprised! Kreator still have it in them. They may not be as thrashy or fast as they used to be, but they have been around for nearly twenty years. I would much prefer bands to attempt change and try different styles instead of continuing to release the same ol' same ol' year after year. As I stated before, this album is not as fast as previous releases and actually is more of a hybrid of thrash combined with more melody...a lot of melody actually, and there is nothing wrong with that. Many of the songs are down right catchy and chocked full of riffs. The guitarists are riff monsters and can shred! Though the solos may not be the most technical out there they are very respectable and hold their own, and bottom line, are enjoyable to listen to, and is not that what matters most? As far as vocals go they have a certain aggressiveness and assertiveness to them and are semi-raspy. Seems to be either you love 'em or hate them; I like them a lot. Most of the lyrical content is typical thrash material: end of the world, death, war, ancient plagues, etc. Again, not supremely great but very good and enough variation on the central them to keep things interesting. Pumping through the mix is the bass. Having bass that is audible on a metal CD is not always the easiest feat to accomplish, so that gives you some sort of idea for the quality of production on \"Enemy of God\". The drums are nice, classic thrash, resplendent with pounding double kick drum rhythms. So it appears I must be traveling onward friends and fellow metal heads, so let me just sum things up by saying this is a great release by the masters of German thrash. Enough of the old mixed with enough new material to kreate just the right amount of sonic destruction. Pick it up new and old fans alike; you will not be disappointed.\n",

      "Review: Yeah, so I'm a Soundgarden fan.  Yeah, I'm not giving this a good rating.  So what?  I'm not doing it out of some kind of insane grudge over the band breaking up, I just gave this album the treatment I would any - I bought it, took it home and listened to it.My biggest problem with the album is that it all sounds like somebody else.  The only time it sounds like Chris Cornell is when it's sounding a bit like Soundgarden, and that's only because Chris Cornell was IN Soundgarden.  I found the entire album almost completely uninvolving, some of it over-dramatic and all of it derivative.The best moments are the ones that cop some of somebody elses brilliance - the ending of &quot;Follow My Way&quot; for example, which is a dead ringer for Radiohead's &quot;Street Spirit&quot;.I don't know.  Chris Cornell was a factor in Soundgarden being a great band, and to his credit he hasn't just tried to duplicate their sound here.  Unfortunately, he hasn't really come up with his own either.  It's depressing for the same reason that Dream Theater are - incredibly capable musicians re-treading the past and done.  Don't get me wrong though, it's not as bad as Dream Theater, this is at least re-treading some bloody good music - pre-Kid-A Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles...  I just kept waiting for a Chris Cornell song to start.\n",

      "Review: After being immersed for years in club music, I've been recently wandering around all musical genres to cultivate more original sources of energetic, workout-motivating music.  Du Hast seduced me with a rare (at least for the  mainstream) mutation of metal and techno that I haven't heard since  Scooter's &quot;Fire&quot;, another song I adore, and so I bought the  album.  It was quite amusing at first, hearing an entire album in German  that reminded me of Mortal Kombat (where Engel resides on a soundtrack) and  WWF Raw music.  But after that novelty wears off the truth reveals itself.  Sensucht and Buck Mich are reasonable runners-up to Du Hast in terms of  catchy, energetic tunes, and Stripped is an interesting closer.  But when  they venture onto power ballads and &quot;plain German hard rock&quot; (not  that I'm an expert on that), sitting through the entire album becomes a  chore.  Next time I suggest that they take what they know works best and  run with it.\n",

I've read some of the reviews, some of which stated (correctly) that this sort of thing is tired already... they are missing the point. Yes, loud, angry, drop-D tuned industrial metal has been around for a while, and countless commercial imitations (and integration into things like television music) have diluted its impact. I was a member of a seminal hardcore band - believe me, I know what I'm talking about.But this is the first time the genre has been mated, under the hand of a master, with historical circumstances that fulfill it completely. Now it makes perfect sense. In short, Jourgensen has finally found a target big, ugly and brutal enough for his previously senseless rage, and we are all richer for it. Unfortunately, it's the perfect soundtrack of our age, the post-9/11, MIHOP \"new normal\". This is not something to celebrate, in fact it's a tragedy. But it's incredibly liberating to not only hear someone speak the truth, but scream it with the 120 DB force of a jetliner crashing into, say a skyscraper.(\"Do you still think that jet fuel brought down the WTC?\" [laughter] - Ministry - Lies, Lies, Lies)[...]\n",

      "Review: I have seen the stage musical more than a half dozen times.  I have loved ABBA music since the 70's and do to this day.  What is on this CD does an injustice to both.How anyone can give this soundtrack a 5 star rating is beyond me.  I can only assume they haven't listened to it.  Meryl Streep, one of my favourite actors, is bearly passable as a singer.  Pierce Brosnan... seriously, who told him he could sing?  Better yet, who HIRED him to sing???  \"When All is Said and Done\" is actually painful to listen to.I'm sorry, I had such wonderful anticipation for this soundtrack and film.  When I heard the casting, I was disappointed, but thought perhaps they all have hidden talents.  THEY DON'T!  I like pretty much all the actors in this movie; especially Meryl Streep and Colin Firth.  But I hope people aren't letting their love and respect for the acting abilities of the many stars of this film, cloud their judgement on just how awful the vocals truly are on this soundtrack.In their ill-advised box office grab to fill this film with as many big names as possible in lieu of getting actors who can actually sing, the producers may just have ruined the theatrical version of one of the most successful musicals in history.\n",

However, if you are intrigued by her artistic progression you may enjoy It's Not Too Late.I personally felt as if I were listening to some scary soundract of a carnival film during the first half of the C.D and just didn't enoy the rest.  I was really hoping that this would be a rivival of her multi-grammy winning unique sound.  But not to be too critical of her.

      "Review: Pure junk. This is NOT real metal. Listen to Iron Maiden. Motorhead, then listen to this junk by Trivium. Then listen to Metallica and tell me if this sounds anything like Metallica. People compare them to the wonderous 80's thrash metal group, which is nonsense because:1. James Hetfield does not scream like a freak. Matt Heafy's voice is awful. It's not like he's even doing death growls or whatever but proper screamo screams. He seems to like bawling his lungs out2. The clean vocals are very emo-ish3. The music is pretty good, but unoriginal and monotonous.4. It's metalcore. Metalcore is a fusion of thrash metal and emo/screamo. The combination of terrible clean vocals plus screamo vocals = metalcoreI don't care if anyone rates this as \"not helpful.\" But I thought I'd give my opinion on this piece of crap. Anyone who tells you this is real metal doesn't know what they are talking about. MTV and the media convince you to believe this is proper heavy/thrash metal. Well it's not. For the well-being of true metal: this is metalcore. There's no way you can listen to those vocals and tell me it's not metalcore. Oh and if you look up the lyrics, you'll see how pathetic they are.\n",

      "Review: A friend of mine really likes this album, but I don't get it.  Other British bands have put out much better music of this style (e.g., Duran Duran, the Police).  I suspect the answer to my confusion is the explicitly communistic lyrics.  Every time someone praises the album, it always seems that they praising the lyrics most strongly. I suspect that the lyrics are thus the aspect of the music that the Housemartin's fans key in on. They are certainly the only distinguishing feature of this band. I don't find the lyrics particularly witty or compelling however, and, when mixed with the derivative music, the whole experience of the album is unsatisfying. The album is thus a lot like contemporary Christian music; the music isn't really all that good, but people like it because they find it inspirational. (There really is a reason why this album never had extensive commercial success.)  If you are a Marxist, this album is for you. Otherwise, you will do better with other '80s bands.\n",

But if PF's more obscure albums are familiar to you, you may feel (like I did) that this album is full of noises that are all too familiar. It almost sounds like he sampled some of his best \"unknown\" guitar licks into a series of new songs.I wanted to like this album -- I really did -- as there were some shining moments on Gilmour's two earlier solo albums. But I have to admit that I was rather disappointed that, after all this time away from recording, that he didn't have a batch of fresh tunes ready. Maybe next time.\n",

      "Review: A lot of critics have been saying recently that drum and bass is going through a bit of a hard patch. This ought to silence them. As far as jungle goes, you'll find no finer exposition than the latest effort from Roni Size and company. Relentless and hard-hitting, but also extremely listenable, In The Mode throws a lot more hip hop into the mix than the more jazz-oriented New Forms. Guest spots from Rahzel, Methodman, Zach from Rage add to the album's credentials but behind it all is the musical genius of Size. Ranging from soulful tracks such as Lucky Pressure and Balanced Chaos to the all-out onslaught of Railing Pt. 2 and Who Told You (both featuring the highly capable Dynamite MCing like a mad thing), In the Mode is a diverse showpiece of the jungle genre. Remembering also that 2001 will bring new albums from Grooverider, Dillinja and jump-up legend Mulder, no-one could honestly that drum and bass is dying. It was just resting for a bit.\n",

The songs all feel like a mishmash of underdeveloped ideas. I don't dislike the album, I'm just disappointed. I liked their first album, but thought they had the potential to do better, to make an album that is great rather than good. With this album they've proven me wrong. If you own their first album I don't think there's any need to pick up this new one. The metal riffs are all very similar, still sounding a lot like Slipknot (pre-wussout) with no progression or improvement, and there are more quiet parts where the music just seems to be played for the sake of it, to make background noise and atmosphere, with little regard for composing any substancial chord progressions and melodies.

      "Review: On amazon.com the reviews for this album are stellar and anyone browsing these reviews would naturally think that this is one of Nicks' best albums ever. They would be wrong. This album climbed up the charts largely due to it's first single Rooms on Fire and then sank like a stone because of word of mouth.The production on this album is horrible, and for the most part, so is Nicks voice. It sounds as if she is just going through the motions as she bealts out the tunes like a goat. Then again, most of the songs on this album are mediocre at best and don't deserve much attention. One song that is definitely ruined by the production is Cry Wolf. This is well written, alluring song, but it was not mean't to be synthesized or sang this way.There are some memorable highlights, however. Rooms on Fire is definitely worthy of a listen and so is Juliet with Hornsby jangly piano and Alice with Kenny G beautiful Sax playing. Also, Ooh My Love does cast a spell.As far as songwriting craftsmenship, Nicks has definitely lost her touch. None of these songs really pack the punch of any song on Bella Donna or The Wild Heart.However, you would never know it by reading the reviews written by her fans who douse the review section on amazon.com with praise trying to raise sells for their queen.It's totally frustrating.

The first like 7 are good then a few pick up the pace. To me and i am not a fan of rnb rap songs but my fav is \"No better love\" the beat is great and the hook is soulfull. Are they the future of the Roc, i think so they just need to spice up there beats, probably hook up with Just Blaze and Kanye on the next album and they should pump out about 3 good singles. Overall i think the cd is one i can just jam to. Holla viva la Roc.\n",

      "Review: Maybe YoYo Ma wants to promote Asian music, maybe he wants to create some fusion style, maybe he wants to inject western interpretation into the mysterious thousands of years old culture. He tried it, and tried it hard. But, even with all the good intention the CD doesn't turn out right. Firstly, the instruments are so distinctive, they belong to their own stages, I cannot imagine what kind of harmony it could bring if you put cello, pabla, PIPA or cidar together, or Magonia folk songs and Turkish spiritual music? Secondly, call me conservative, I would like to perserve Asian music's own style as much as I would like to western classical. Granting a western music formula doesn't go along with its melody. Lastly, these music don't mix with each other. I have visited the silk road in Western China and also had a great journey in India. The art and the music are just fascinating, but very different, even though both cultures share lots of common.Listening to this CD is like drinking British style Chinese tea, you can still taste some original tea flavor, but milk and sugar are added.But I applaud to Mr Ma's reaching out of introducing Asian music to the rest of the world.

      "Review: The one and only good thing about this band is the design of the anime alter-egos of the band members. Of course, the band didn't create that impressive art that's used to market themselves in their music videos and CD packaging, so I suppose there really isn't anything good that this band has to offer. At least GWAR made their own costumes. The fact that any musical group has to hide behind cartoon alter-egos of themselves makes you wonder why they have do it. But when you hear Gorallaz' music, it's obvious: Their music is boring and mediocre.Gorillaz just want to be Fishbone. It's a shame that Fishbone, being one of the most talented, ever-evolving, and creative band of black musicians ever to grace the music world, never got this kind of attention. Too bad none of you know about them, because if you did, you'd be listening to them instead of Gorallaz. Have a taste for Funk/Punk/Heavy Metal? Then get Give a Monkey a Brain. Have a taste for Ska/Power Pop? Get Fishbone's s/t album and Truth & Soul. I guarantee you won't come back to Demon Days.\n",

      "Review: I must confess that I loved first 3 TOT albums and hated with my whole black heart Musique, actually I thought it was the most horrible thing I'd ever heard and when I heard the single \"Let You Down\" I thought this would be another Musique. I've been listening to this CD all day long, and it's begun to grow on me. Of course it has nothing to do with Aegis, Velvet Darkness or TOT's debut album, those were 3 masterpieces, but Assembly is not as bad as it was Musique, this one sounded better produced, music was far more creative than Musique's, and even though lyrics here are still a bit silly, some of them deserve to be read. There some good moments on this album (Superdrive, which sounds very much like Garbage's Run Baby Run, Starlit and Envision, for example). Automatic Lover has a very good melody, the only thing I found disgusting were the lyrics, too repetitive, and too focused on creating a catchy song that you can sing along with your friends as you drive your car and drink vodka. Let You Down is also good after all, it has something that i can't describe and that simply made me fall in love with the song, despiting the bad impression I had when I first heard it.Another nice song is Flickerlight, again too Garbage-ish, but still good.Basically this is not an excellent album, but it still has some good things on it and certainly was very much better than Musique. I'd recommend that you get a few songs (or even the whole album) from internet, and if you like the songs enough, then go to buy it (that's what I did, but I'm not so sure yet about buying it or not).And, in case you find this really disgusting, you might want to check out Liv Kristine's new band \"Leaves' Eyes\", whose albums Lovelorn and Vinland Saga are very good (specially Lovelorn, which is already my favorite).\n",

      "Review: If I were reviewing the original master of this album I'd give it a four. It's not as good as their debut Last Decade/Dead Century, but it certainly has some great moments.From the first notes the sound is so distorted and brickwalled that it's painful to listen to at any volume. NO; I did NOT listen to the whole album. I had a splitting migraine that began from the first track. I briefly contemplated suicide before realizing that I could just turn it off and listen to the original master.My recommendation is to get the original Geffen pressing. There's just no need for this sort of overcompression and I wonder how much the \"professional\" was actually paid to screw up a decent recording like this. I bought this thinking it may be an \"upgrade,\" and learned my lesson the hard way.(This review is not a reflection of the seller. The product arrived in a very timely manner and in the condition stated. Kudos for that.)Get the original and don't subject yourself to this weapons-grade stupidity.

      "Review: There is really nothing bad to say about this album.  Its not good.  Its not bad.  Its just there, which is why I am dissapointed with this release.I started listening to NIN during the Downward Spiral era.  That album took a while to grow on me, but once I got it, I really got it, and I couldn't stop listening to it for months.  Even now, I listen to the recording quite often.Then I went back to Pretty Hate machine.  I loved it.  Great album, awesome lyrics, awesome songs.  Nothing bad to say.  I was too young to enjoy the real experience of that time, but I felt like I could understand it.Now the real time for me was when The Fragile came out.  I loved the build up to the release of this album.  The NIN website was updated almost everyday with new pictures, teasers, etc.  After it was released, they updated their page with tour photos, reviews, videos, etc.  I love the album, I played it 2 or 3 times a day.  I just loved Trent for making awesome music and lyrics that just went straight to your heart.  You knew he was bleeding out emotion when he screamed the lyrics on earlier releases.Now.  He's just going through the motions.  There is no intesnsity, there is no emotion.  The screams are there, the haunting whispers are there, but it means nothing anymore.  I saw them live at Coachella, and while Trent and company ALWAYS put on an awesome show, I just couldn't help but feel that this is something that he doesn't want to be doing anymore.In the past I could feel Trent's energy through his albums, through his website, and of course through his live performances.  Now it just feels like a greatest hits band.  This album is not cohesive at all like other releases.  Just a collection of OK songs that will appeal to a younger NIN audience and soccer moms.Dont get me wrong.  Alright album.  Nothing like the emotional stab to my heart everytime I heard another great NIN album for the first time.  I hope that Trent can regain the drive he felt earlier, but I think that most of the time, when its gone, its gone.I will always treasure the old releases though and I wish trent and company the best.\n",

      "Review: I enjoy this genre of music very much (Enigma, Deep Forest, Amethysium, etc) and like the musical content of this CD a lot.  Unfortunately, the production is terrible!  Either during production or mastering, someone had the bright idea to compress the dynamic range very heavily, and it is just impossible to ignore.  There are many places where bass notes alternate with rests, such as track 6, and when the bass note is sounding the treble is modulated WAY down... If you know what I mean, you need no explanation, but if you don't -- imagine the cymbals going TSSSS tsss TSSSS tssss, loud and quiet, depending on whether there is a bass note overpowering them.  The vocals, of course, are similarly modulated, as is the background keyboards etc.  It's like listening to it over an FM station that's trying to max out their signal loudness.Don't imagine that I only hear this because I'm an audiophile or something.  I noticed this in the puny little system in my '92 Mazda Protege, then confirmed that it's really there when I got home and listened to it through my Sennheiser HD590s.I'm going to give the album away.  I just can't listen to it.\n",

      "Review: Emery's last album, \"The Weaks End\" was one of those albums with a couple of standout tracks (Walls, Ponytail Parades) that made you think that on the next go around, they would have zeroed in on what makes them tick a bit better. Sadly, this is not the case.For those unfamiliar with Emery, they are a vaugely emo, vaugely Christian 6 piece who employed the usual scream-sing tactic on their first outing. This time around, they lean much more to the singing end of things, with varied results. It's quite a standard affair up until \"Listening to Freddie Mercury\" which has a great middle passage, but disolves into cliched teen angst lyrics. From then on things get simply, well, dull.And that's the main problem with this record; Emery clearly has something on their mind, but cannot convey the depth required to make the music effectively moving. Musically, frankly, it's boring. Every instrument is played competently, but that's it;there is no resonance. Stock guitar lines, badly mixed, boring keyboard flourishes, and tasteless drumming litter the album. That may sound harsher than it is intended; these guys CAN play, they just don't know WHAT to play.Perhaps the music would be more inspired if their vocal lines weren't so predictable. Devin Shelton and Toby Morell try hard to inject some of the energy that made select cuts from \"The Weaks End\" seem so promising, but ironically, by shifting the emphisis away from solid songwriting to follow more abstract ideas they wind up sounding without purpose or conviction.Sure, if you're looking for straight ahead pseudo-emo, by all means, dig in, but if you're are looking for anything deeper, be warned, not only does Emery not answer \"The Question\", they're still not sure what \"The Question\" is.\n",

      "Review: I love Gary Numan's music. His last few albums have been brilliant, overlooked gems that I've throughly enjoyed. \"Jagged,\" however, shows Numan stuck in a rut, repeating what he did on previous albums \"Exile\" and \"Pure.\" It's as if time has stood still for him for the last ten or so years. Any of the songs from \"Jagged\" could comfortably fit on either \"Exile\" or \"Pure\" and no one would be the wiser. Is that a bad thing? No -- not if these songs were all released at the same time; but to release the same album over the past seven years -- that's not a good thing.Now, there are some great musical ideas here and there, but they're hidden amongst muddy vocals and extended intros. One song tends to blend into the next, rendering them to be indistinguishable from one another. \"Jagged\" could be one extended fifty minute song.If you're under the impression that Gary Numan was a one hit wonder...well, you're wrong. Here, you have an artist with a rich and varied back catalog of material, much of which sounds as good today as it did twenty years ago. \"Jagged\" certainly bears the unmistakable sound that marks it as Gary Numan, but it is not the best place to start if you're new to his music. That honor would go to \"Sacrifice,\" \"The Pleasure Principle,\" \"Telekon,\" or \"Replicas.\" Better yet, there are any number of greatest hits albums to give you a good sampling of his music.\"Jagged\" won't be changing the world, but it is a fairly good album -- one worthy of a few listens. Unfortunately, it's a retread of what Numan's done before. He's always been an artist not content to rest on his laurels and forge ahead. It's time to do that here -- drop the goth-metal approach and branch off in a new direction. That's one thing he's always been able to do -- stike off on a new path with surprising success.\n",

This album diffinately has some real good tracks, theres no question about that but overall it was awful. The lyrics were easily the best part of this album but the guitars and vocals were poor at best. The thing is this band calls themself screamo-core without actually screaming.The drums are also extremely weak on this album. Just too much guitar i guess. It's like every bass part just got blown away making the instrumentation terrible. No bass, no bass drum, not even a low E on the guitars. The balance was awful. The vocals seemed a bit off key as well, and singers like that need at least to keep in tune.They also define themselves as hardcore. I honestly don't see whats so hardcore about them. I soft singer, fair guitars, little to no bass, and weak drums. Wheres the screaming, the solos, the hurtful vocals, and broken power chords. Overall, tracks 1,3, and 9, are the only reason i haven't sold this album yet. Buy it only if your really into EMO.\n",

Her hunger is the beast awaiting you every time you put this cd in the car, that cannot be denied. Her features and beats on the other hand need some work.

      "Review: NOTICE: If you do not have this record, do not buy it without finishing reading this review.THIRD STAGE is not near as good a record as the band's previous two (DON'T LOOK BACK and BOSTON). The main reason for this is more than likely that the band is gone. Brad Delp (mainly lead and harmony vocals) and Tom Scholtz (mainly guitar) were the only band members left at that point, leaving Boston in a dark spot; Tom Scholtz covered most of the music (shining a light on his almost overly-apparent talent), but he overdid it - far too many overdubs (even for Boston) were added, and more than 80% of the record's drums are recreated through keyboards (drum simulators, if you may). There is hardly any natural sound; the acoustic twelve-string guitars are essential to the album. Without them, this album would be blow-dried, air-conditioned claustrophobia wrapped into a disc.THIRD STAGE gets an rounded 3 stars from me, the result of disappointment and a reverse effect: certain things can 'grow on you' over time, but this seemed to 'grow off me' over time. It might seem great when you buy it, but that will change.DO NOT EXPECT THE BOSTON FROM THE 70'S - YOUR EXPECTATIONS WILL FAIL YOU!\n",
